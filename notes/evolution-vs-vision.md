*Introduction. Beauty vs Metrics - Historical Context: Designer and artist. Evolving of design culture. - Shift from CS to designers in interface design. - Bright examples. - Impact: Consequences for designers, users, and design culture. - Future implications: The potential "two-tier" design ecosystem*

Some things I observe during recent years of my practice:

- Is metrics culture jeopardising aesthetical aspects of product design? Is current product design culture inflating beauty? 
- Tension between aesthetic value and business utility in product design. 
- Iterative metrics-driven evolution vs. design/ artistic vision and intention. 
- Utilitarian vs. aesthetical value
- How is it affecting the millieu/discource community of designers?

Opinion: modern product design jeopardises â€˜design cultureâ€™ (where designers criticise each other on not only the solution of a problem, but also the aesthetic side of the result) by turning design solely into a way of achieving business goals, in particular the manipulation of business metrics.

Terms:
- By **Design culture** I mean organisational culture in the team of designers, as well as the conventions and ideas of what good designer should do and how. For example, typography designers have their culture and ideas of what is good (9-12 words in the line, paragraph indent instead of skipping the line, book page proportions, font aesthetics) and will defend those arguments.
- By **aesthetics** here I mean not just (wiki:) branch of [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy") concerned with the nature of [beauty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty "Beauty") and [taste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste_\(sociology\) "Taste (sociology)"), which in a broad sense incorporates the **philosophy of art**.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics#cite_note-slater-1) But the conventions in the designers minds and opinions regarding what is beauty and taste in design practice and products of this practice.

Formula "Form follows function", formed by an american architect Louis Sullivan, has been the main principle of practice in any design field since the beginning of 20th century. But is aesthetics of this form the part of the equation anymore?

Some designers raise concerns and even share their rage. Current product design paradigm says, that if it's working â€“ it is enough. If the UI solution shows the highest performance in manipulating metric â€“ it is the best one.

So, the scale now is not being "ugly or beautiful", but "bringing revenue or not".
Designers have become engineers, marketers, product managers. They don't answer the question "Is it beautiful", they answer "Is it impacting the metric".

Functionality becomes not the measure of how fast and successful the user performs their task but how beneficial it is for the business. Does revenue growth and monetary business success equal good user experience and good design?
