## Simple chores, not simple memory
I often (always) forget when I did a simple chore and when I should do it next time. Like me, many people struggle with such things: visiting a gynaecologist for a yearly check-up, adding salt to the dishwasher, changing contact lenses, or grooming a dog so he doesn’t look like an old carpet.

I thought, there can be an ideal tool for this special type of task that:
- Doesn’t have strong deadlines.
- Nothing bad will happen if you are a bit late.
- Should be done once in a while.

My principles of a not-a-reminder-app would be the following:
- Focus on *regularity*, not deadlines.
- No anxiety, no penalties.
- No red “Overdue” tags.

> The point isn’t to show the exact number of days since I last did something. It’s to answer a simple question:
**“Should I do it now, or can it wait until Saturday?”**

## How this can work
Say I open a new pack of contact lenses, which I should wear for 1–1.5 months. I create a task: *Change contact lenses*, set the interval to 1.5 months, save it and mark it as *Done today*. 

Next time I wonder, When should I change them again? I just open the app. It tells me:
- **Nothing to do yet**
- **"Will be soon"** (a week before, for example)
- **Should be done** (once the due date arrives)

If I see *Should be done* – I head to the bathroom and put in a new pack.

After the task is overdue, timestamps can be based on weeks and months:
- It's been a week.
- It's been 3 weeks.
- It's been a month.
- It's been 2 months.
