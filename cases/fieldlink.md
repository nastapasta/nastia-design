## About
The client came to us with a need to get rid of dozens of complicated Google Sheets, where they stored and filled their construction quality checklists, and replace it with a bespoke usable solution. A paid solution provides too many features, and the customer needed one small part dedicated to quality control.

The challenge was to cover their standard processes with ability to adapt them to at least 10% of non-standard cases.

This was a fixed price project, so in 2 months we had to carefully prioritize and deliver features that could become the foundation of a scaling internal product.

## Discovery
The discovery phase took only two weeks. In internal solutions, user roles are not so important as personas, so we worked for two main user roles:
- Superintendent — the person inspecting the construction site based on the set of specific tasks and parameters;
- **Manager**, which was my focus. It was divided into three more with different levels of management access, but here we will focus on the one that has access to all the features.

### Research activities:
- Stakeholder interviews — the ones who are going to be our immediate users
- Desk research of the domain
- Competitor research

### Manager's problems:
- Making checklists is a long and laborious job.
- All of the company's projects are very similar but slightly different, which makes it likely that mistakes will be made when creating checklists for a new project.
- It's important to see a big picture of how fast and consistently the checklist is being filled, to spot and solve the problems as early as possible, which leads to eyeballing the Google sheets with a lot of textual data.

## Design Solution
Initial iteration of the web app is a control center with basic data displayed. We used Radix design system for its cleanness and adaptability.

We had to descope reporting and leave it for the future phase. Many other features, such as checklist/project duplicates and templates were descoped too. We focused on main manager’s tasks:

## Results
The first iteration of the product is delivered to the client for internal testing and use.
