    <h2>It was long ago, and I was wrong</h2> 
    <p>This concept explores the idea of outsourcing the ‚Äúconnecting the dots‚Äù to the machine. While I believe that piles of notes <em>can</em> be sorted and cleaned up, I also believe apophenia ‚Äî that rare spark of unexpected meaning ‚Äî is something we should reserve for ourselves.</p>

<h2>Project Brief</h2>
<p>Zettel is a note-taking app that helps people connect their thoughts using natural language processing. Designed for knowledge lovers, thinkers, and researchers, it encourages flow without forcing structure upfront.</p>
<p>This was a personal solo project from 0‚Üí1: research, UX, UI, illustration, pitching ‚Äî all done by me.</p>

## The Problem
### Our attention spans are shrinking, but information keeps growing.
Gloria Mark, a professor of information science at the University of California, Irvine, and the author of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60795084-attention-span">"Attention Span"</a>, began researching how people use computers in 2004. Back then, the average duration individuals spent focused on a single screen was 2.5 minutes. 

‚ÄúI was astounded. That was so much worse than I‚Äôd thought it would be.‚Äù By 2012, Mark and her colleagues found the average time on a single task was 75 seconds. Now it‚Äôs down to about 47.

Although the time we spend focusing on something is decreasing, the amount of knowledge we have to process is not. Many of us have ways of collecting our notes and thoughts: from sticky notes and saved messages in the chat with oneself, to Zettelkastens, to Tiago Forte‚Äôs PARA method, to Roam research graphs.

But most note-taking tools focus on capturing ‚Äî not connecting ‚Äî ideas. Even power users find themselves manually copying and pasting their notes into external systems, hoping to make sense of it all later.

## Research

To understand how people manage their sporadic notes, I conducted a survey and five semi-structured interviews with deep readers, researchers, and note hoarders.

During the interviews, *three main user types* emerged in my sight:

<div class=three-grid>
    <div>
        <img class=small-grid-image src="/images/case-studies/zettel/grid-user-curious.png">
        <h4>The Curious</h4>
        <p>Has a reading addiction.<br>Wants to formulate an opinion. <br>Answers the questions.<br>Has no specific goal</p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <img class=small-grid-image src="/images/case-studies/zettel/grid-user-write.png">
        <h4>The Writer</h4>
        <p>Prone to ADHD.<br>Uses a lot of sources simultaneously.<br>Creative, not always systematic</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img class=small-grid-image src="/images/case-studies/zettel/grid-user-researcher.png">
        <h4>The Researcher</h4>
        <p>Thorough.<br>Requires a solid system of sources.<br>Operates hundreds of files: books, pictures, links, maps.</p>
    </div>
</div>

What they all shared:
- A desire to make connections.
- Difficulty remembering where they read or heard something.
- A patchwork of tools, rituals, and frustration.

## Defining the Needs

From the interviews, four core problem areas stood out:

<div class=two-grid>
    <div>
        <img class=small-grid-image src="/images/case-studies/zettel/grid-recalling.png">
        <h4>Issues with recalling</h4>
        <p>‚ÄúWhere did I read that again?‚Äù</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img class=small-grid-image src="/images/case-studies/zettel/grid-connectivity.png">
        <h4>Disconnected thoughts</h4>
        <p>‚ÄúHow does this tie into what I wrote last week?‚Äù</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img class=small-grid-image src="/images/case-studies/zettel/grid-planning.png">
        <h4>Planning struggles</h4>
        <p> ‚ÄúWhat should I read or revisit next? How will I find this reference?‚Äù</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img class=small-grid-image src="/images/case-studies/zettel/grid-structure.png">
        <h4>Fear of a clean slate</h4>
        <p>‚ÄúDo I need to figure out my whole system before I even start?‚Äù</p>
    </div>
</div>


How might we‚Ä¶
- Suggest connections across scattered thoughts?
- Make structuring optional and gentle?
- Let users capture quickly, connect gradually?

<div class="large-divider"></div>

### Zettel introduces a more intuitive, assisted way of connecting thoughts:

<div class=two-grid>
    <div>
        <img class=small-grid-image src="/images/case-studies/zettel/grid-recalling-help.png">
        <h4>Assisted structuring</h4>
        <p>Automated tagging and structuring suggestions.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img class=small-grid-image src="/images/case-studies/zettel/grid-connectivity-help.png">
        <h4>Assisted linking</h4>
        <p>Create linked records right away.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img class=small-grid-image src="/images/case-studies/zettel/grid-planning-help.png">
        <h4>Fast referencing</h4>
        <p>‚ÄúHow can this idea be connected to all the others?‚Äù</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img class=small-grid-image src="/images/case-studies/zettel/grid-structure-help.png">
        <h4>Easy input</h4>
        <p>Initially 'flat' structure. No need to bother where to create a new file.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="large-divider"></div>

## Design Process
As a sole member of the team, I had to use my subtle abilities to create a prototype. I had no technical ability, only Figma. Fortunately, design thinking is not something I had to be taught of.

I'll omit the prototypes on purpose: we all have seen thousands of notes, storymaps, sketches, and wireframes.

<!-- Story Mapping led to designing main user flow and features.

ILo-fi Sketches helped to visualise flow and screen types

Piles of sketches and wireframes slowly turned into prototypes:

## The Solution
I focused on mobile-first interactions, imagining real-life use: walking, listening to a podcast, or quickly capturing a thought in a caf√©. So, the journey resulted in a Figma prototype of a solution as simple as your "Saved messages" inbox in messenger, with some twists.

## Outcome
Time to pitch! The finale of the sandbox was the public presentation and pitching, demonstrating the whole work: target auditory research, market research, business model (all of them I omitted in this publication) and a prototype.

The project won 1st Prize in Coherent Solutions Innovation Sandbox (Autumn 2023)

## Reflection

### What I learned:
- Software is secondary (although the medium is always the message). What matters is learning to actually think (surprise!).
- Community matters. I didn‚Äôt fully believe in the idea until I saw others resonate with it.
- It‚Äôs not just a product. It‚Äôs a question about how we relate to knowledge, memory, and attention.

### What's next
I‚Äôm continuing to explore how people manage personal knowledge ‚Äî either by developing this idea further or studying it from a more anthropological perspective.
If this resonates with you or you want to collaborate ‚Äî drop me a message. I'd love to chat.
