        <p> For years, I’ve been designing experiences through space, education, and collaboration. While studying architecture, I organised educational events for students meet peers from across Europe, and built small projects together. With friends, we hosted a <a href="https://sesam2018.tilda.ws/">10-day architecture workshop</a> in a small Belarusian village. My favorite architect is Peter&nbsp;Zumthor, Zumthor, and my personal dream — maybe a little selfish — is to design and build a home for my family.</p>
        <p> In the beginning of the final year in the master's program, I discovered UX&nbsp;design and liked it. Eventually, I earned Master degree in architecture. As a tutor for second year students, the group and I were explored how human-centered design methods could be applied to urban design.</p>
        <p class="big framed">In my work, I try to live by my values — being strong and kind — in ways that are meaningful for people and beneficial to the businesses that serve them.</p>
        <p>English is neither my first nor second language, so I may still make mistakes. Thanks for understanding.</p>

        <p> Right now, I'm developing this site using plain HTML and CSS. The code is stored in a <a href="https://github.com/nastapasta/nastia-design">public GitHub repository</a>. Also I'm using a simple open-source static site generator <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> with help of tutorials and ChatGPT to hunt the bugs. Deployment is handled by <a href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</a>.</p>
        <p> For typography I chose <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Instrument+Sans">Instrument Sans</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Serif+4">Source Serif 4</a>, available on Google Fonts.</p>
