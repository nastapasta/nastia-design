        <p class="big framed">In my work, I try to live by my values — <em>being strong and&nbsp;kind</em> — in ways
            that are meaningful for people and beneficial to the businesses that serve them.</p>
        <p> For years, I’ve been creating experiences through space, education, and collaboration. While studying, I
            organised educational events for students to meet peers from across Europe and built small projects
            together. With friends, we hosted a <a href="https://sesam2018.tilda.ws/">10-day architecture workshop</a>
            in a small Belarusian village. Also, I'm Peter&nbsp;Zumthor's fangirl, and one day I will design and build a
            home for my family.</p>
        <p> In the beginning of my master's program, I discovered UX&nbsp;design and liked it. Eventually, I finished my
            studies, where, as a tutor for a group of students, I explored with the group, how human-centered methods
            could help us design a park.</p>

                    <p>I ask silly questions and try to understand what exactly the problem is. I'm trained in product
                        management, so I'll even ask you why you've decided to do all of this.

                    <p>My experience is mostly within cross-functional teams, from wich I learned to validate the
                        solutions with the dev team as early as possible: good design should be implementable.</p>

        <p>Now I'm working as a UX designer in an outsourcing company, playing around in a huge variety of
            industries
            and businesses: from huge public transportation systems to experimental AI-powered customer service
            products.</p>

        <p> Right now, I'm developing this site using plain HTML and CSS. It's constantly changing until I get it to a
            relatively acceptable form, but the overall view and structure are stable. Kind of a <em>Theseus ship</em>.
        </p>
        <p>The code is stored in a <a href="https://github.com/nastapasta/nastia-design">public GitHub repository</a>.
            I'm using a simple open-source static site generator <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> with help
            of tutorials and ChatGPT to hunt the bugs. Deployment is handled by <a href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</a>.
        </p>
        <p> For typography I chose <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Instrument+Sans">Instrument Sans</a> and
            <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Serif+4">Source Serif 4</a>, available on Google Fonts.
