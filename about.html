        <p> For years I’ve been dedicated to designing experiences through space, education, and collaborative processes. Between 2014—2021 I studied architecture, organising educational events for students and taking them to meet architecture students in Europe. With my friends, we made a <a href="https://sesam2018.tilda.ws/">10 days architecture school</a> in a small Belarusian village. My favorite architect is Peter&nbsp;Zumthor, and my big dream is to design and build my own home with a garden full of&nbsp;flowers. </p>
        <p> In the beginning of my master year I jumped into UX&nbsp;design and liked it. Eventually, I obtained Master degree in architecture, where, as a tutor of the second year students, I was finding out, how we can apply human-centered design methodology in urban design.</p>
        <p class="big framed">In my work, I aim to fulfil my values – being strong and kind – in a way beneficial for people and businesses these people need.</p>

        <p> Right now, I'm developing this site using plain HTML and CSS. Code is stored in a <a href="https://github.com/nastapasta/nastia-design">public GitHub repository</a> and deployed by Vercel. Also I'm using a simple open-source static site generator <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>with help of tutorials and ChatGPT.</p>
        <p> For typography I chose <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Instrument+Sans">Instrument Sans</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Serif+4">Source Serif 4</a>, available on Google Fonts.</p>
