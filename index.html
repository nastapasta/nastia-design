            <p>I design with Figma or with code, draw by hand, in ProCreate, or Illustrator. I'm familiar with Jira and Confluence, and can work with Microsoft Azure DevOps. I worked mostly in cross-functional teams, and as a part of design teams of 10+ people too.

        <h2>What I'm about</h2>
        <p> For years I’ve been dedicated to designing experiences through space, education, and collaborative processes. Between 2014—2021 I studied architecture, organising educational events for students and taking them to meet architecture students in Europe. With my friends, we made a 10 days architecture school in a small Belarusian village. My favorite architect is Peter Zumthor. My dream is to design and build my own home with a garden. </p>
        <p> In the beginning of my master year I jumped into UX design and liked it. Eventually, I obtained Master degree in architecture, where, as a tutor of the second year students, I was finding out, how we can apply human-centered design methodology in urban design.</p>
        <p class="big framed">In my work, I aim to fulfil my values – being strong and kind – in a way beneficial for people and businesses these people need.</p>
