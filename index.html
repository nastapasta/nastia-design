  <p style="max-width: 720px;">Currently I want to focus on designing products that leverage the best from new
    technologies. I am capable of combining product design with product management
    responsibilities. As a graduate architect, I am a useful asset in products dedicated to emerging
    technologies in <em>civil engineering, architecture, and urban design</em>.</p>
