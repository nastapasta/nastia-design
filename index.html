            <p>I design with Figma or with code. Illustrations are drawn by hand, in ProCreate, or Illustrator. I'm familiar with Jira and Confluence, and can work with Microsoft Azure DevOps. I worked mostly in cross-functional teams, and as a&nbsp;part of design teams of 10+ people too. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1837dY2GtDSrBJ3toO2yfehnZKUz5hSI1/view">Here is my CV.</a>

            <h2>What I'm about</h2>
            <p> For years Iâ€™ve been dedicated to designing experiences through space, education, and collaborative processes. Between 2014â€”2021 I studied architecture, organising educational events for students and taking them to meet architecture students in Europe. With my friends, we made a <a href="https://sesam2018.tilda.ws/">10 days architecture school</a> in a small Belarusian village. My favorite architect is Peter&nbsp;Zumthor, and my big dream is to design and build my own home with a garden full of&nbsp;flowers. </p>
            <p> In the beginning of my master year I jumped into UX&nbsp;design and liked it. Eventually, I obtained Master degree in architecture, where, as a tutor of the second year students, I was finding out, how we can apply human-centered design methodology in urban design.</p>
            <p class="big framed">In my work, I aim to fulfil my values â€“ being strong and kind â€“ in a way beneficial for people and businesses these people need.</p>

            <p> Right now, I'm developing this site using plain HTML and CSS. Code is stored in a <a href="https://github.com/nastapasta/nastia-design">public GitHub repository</a> and deployed by Vercel.</p>
            <p> For typography I chose <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Instrument+Sans">Instrument Sans</a> by Rodrigo Fuenzalida and Jordan Egstad, available on Google Fonts. I love its elegance and lightness.</p>
