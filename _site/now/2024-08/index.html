  <p>I'm writing this first update on the last day of a summer that has been truly transformative this year (though I'm not fond of this word). So, this log will be relatively long; I'm sorry.</p>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>At the end of May, after filling out an application full of despair and a loss of sense in the tech industry and my work in particular, I was selected as a mentee in the <a href="https://www.wintech.me">Women in Tech</a> mentorship program. Almost three months have passed very fast: I didn’t have many resources to attend all the events, mini groups, and networking (probably I just don't want to stop sucking at networking and small talk).</p>
<p>But they also resulted in meeting my unforgettable mentor and a bunch of like-minded people, learning goal-setting techniques (and finding out that &quot;being strong and kind&quot; is not a goal), finally reading <a href="https://productdesigninterview.com/the-path-to-senior-product-designer">&quot;The Path to Senior Product Designer&quot;</a>, and creating the site you are reading at the moment. <em>Upd from april 2024: I'm transferring to this website all the content from that old Framer portfolio I was writing about in this note.</em></p>
<p>Naturally, I'm already planning how to rewrite it properly instead of using a no-code tool. After some years of working within teams, I've built an opinion that a good designer has to learn to deliver just to be relatively independent. <em>Upd from april 2024: She was right.</em> So now I have plans to learn HTML and CSS, and then React, JS, and choose a framework. I've found some useful resources: <a href="https://web.dev/learn/html/">Learn HTML</a> and <a href="https://web.dev/learn/css/">CSS</a> and <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io">Frontend Mentor</a>. It's going to be a long path.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>I've read <a href="https://lobsangtenpa.com/">Lobsang Tenpa's</a> book on meditation and am now trying to incorporate it into my daily life. That also led me to get back to yoga classes I once stopped attending after appendectomy. It's taught by a master who says things like &quot;If you came here to relax, you entered the wrong door&quot; and &quot;It's good that doctors recommend yoga. Why? Right, because it changes the way you look at death.&quot; No regrets.</p>
<p>As a person who's &quot;clever, but lazy,&quot; I eventually understood that the chaos I have in my mind is transmitted to the users I work for because it directly influences the product. It's getting better, although I have to deal with the mistakes I made earlier on.</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<p>Started a reading club and am currently mentally preparing myself to schedule the first meeting.<br>
Cut bangs.<br>
Got myself <a href="https://www.patternlanguage.com/">A Pattern Language</a> by K. Alexander, which I've been dreaming of since architecture school.<br>
Booked tickets to my first real two-week vacation by the sea (earlier, I only attended events that took place somewhere where you could have a swim).<br>
Watched Alien: Romulus and was deeply satisfied.</p>
