#### Making 

The main thing — I've released this site and retired the old one. A week after, I saw a personal site of another product designer from the same HTML/CSS course and got jealous: mine is not so design-y.

#### Doing

We've been living in Belgrade for more than a month already. I've learned Serbian well enough to buy a pie in the bakery and find out from the kashier why I can't exchange an old $100 banknote. Housewarming went well, and now we have a bottle of rakija at home we don't know what to do with. Made some friends on a meetup after complaining about sign up flow in the local bank mobile app.

Working with two mentees and questioning my relationships with modern feedback culture.
