Learning basics of web development, and have already deployed my CV html file on GitHub pages. I won’t be sharing it anywhere else, of course, since it’s quite simple and not even adapted for mobile screens. (shame). Next steps in the plan are:

- Going back to Git to learn how to deploy it not by uploading the file by drag-and-drop;
- Learning the basics of responsive web;
- Learning JS to build nice buttons.

We’ve paused the work with one of the clients client, and now I'm lazily building the case study. Currently I'm enjoying a one week pause before rolling into the next project. This one will be short, focusing mostly on business analysis with almost no UX — just as I’d hoped a couple of months ago.

I’m also finishing [The Edge of Sentience](https://www.edgeofsentience.com) (interesting but sometimes deeply disturbing) with the book club and already looking for another book at the intersection of technology and life.
